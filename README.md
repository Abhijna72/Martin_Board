# MartinBoard

MartinBoard is a wild 3x6 split mechanical keyboard project that screams personality and performance. It’s split, it’s curved, and it’s got a Lockheed Martin aircraft literally flying across its PCB. Designed with ergonomics and flair in mind, MartinBoard is the perfect daily driver for folks who want to vibe while they type.

Built around a low-profile staggered columnar layout, the board features all the comfort of a split setup while keeping things compact and punchy. Whether you're a coder, typist, or just someone who likes to build stuff that looks sick on the desk, MartinBoard delivers.

## What makes it special

MartinBoard isn’t your average DIY keyboard. It brings together clean routing, tight ergonomics, and just the right amount of spice. Each half is packed with 18 keys, plus a thumb cluster that actually makes sense. The top of the PCB is graced with a subtle silhouette of a Lockheed Martin jet, turning the whole board into a functional art piece. The goal? Form, function, and flex  all in one.

This board supports hot-swap sockets, per-key RGB (if you're into that), and it plays nice with Pro Micros or other Atmega32u4 based controllers. Firmware? QMK of course. You can remap this thing to do literally whatever you want.
